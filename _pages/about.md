Earlier this year I defended my doctoral thesis on the political economy of protest, which traces the uneven distribution of development and globalization gains between regions and individuals and test their potential to fuel social unrest. The main findings of my thesis show that both development and globalization profit predominantly high-skilled labor in developing and emerging markets. However, the uneven distribution of gains does not automatically result in protest, social unrest only becomes more prevalent when large parts of the local population lose out from these economic transformations. 

At the moment I am working on a new project that looks at the long-term consequences of economic decline.
