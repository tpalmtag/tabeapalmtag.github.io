I am a postdoctoral researcher in the UZH`s Research Priority Program "Equality of Opportunity" working on a project researching the "Perceptions and Politicization of Inequalities". Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at the chair for international relations and international political economy. I received my PhD from the University of Zurich with a thesis on the political economy of protest with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan African countries. My research focuses on the politics of inequality, the longterm consequences of economic decline for political preference formation, the distributional effects of globalization and economic transformations and their political effects.
Spatial disparities of economic performance and international integration within countries are central to my research, which is why I am interested in working with spatially disaggregated data more generally.
