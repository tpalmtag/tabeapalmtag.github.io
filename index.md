I am a postdoctoral researcher at the chair for international relations and international political economy. I received my PhD from the University of Zurich with a thesis on the political economy of protest with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan African countries. My research focuses on the distributional effects of economic globalization and its societal effects, especially globalization`s impact on social conflict. I am also interested in the spatial disparities of integration and economic performance in general and have therefore a special interest in working with spatially disaggregated data. At the moment I am working on the effect of economic transformations on intergenerational mobility and political preferences of mobile and immobile people.
