I am a postdoctoral researcher at the chair for international relations and international political economy. I received my PhD from the University of Zurich with a thesis on the political economy of protest with a particular focus on Sub-Saharan African countries. My research focuses on the distributional effects of economic globalization and its societal effects, especially globalization's impact on social conflict. \
Spatial disparities of international integration and economic performance within countries are central to my research, which is why I am interested in working with spatially disaggregated data more generally. At the moment, I am also working on the effect of economic transformations on intergenerational mobility and political preferences of mobile and immobile people.
